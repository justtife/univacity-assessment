## üß± Component Architecture Overview

This project follows a modular and scalable architecture, designed for maintainability and potential integration into monorepo setups like Nx.

### Folder Structure

- **`pages/`**: Contains all feature-based page components.
- **`components/`**: Shared reusable UI components. A root barrel file (`component.ts`) is used to export all components, supporting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) pattern and cleaner imports.
- **`services/`**: Houses all API and data handling logic.
- **`models/`**: Defines TypeScript interfaces and data models.
- **`ngrx/`**: Implements state management using NgRx, organized into:
  - `actions/`
  - `reducers/`
  - `effects/`
  - `selectors/`
  - `state/`

This layered architecture ensures:

- Separation of concerns
- High testability and reusability
- Centralized filter state for cross-component synchronization
- Standalone components for better isolation
- Memoized selectors for state access
- Loose coupling between components and data sources
- Easy integration with Nx-based or Domain-Driven Design (DDD) applications.

State management via NgRx allows for global and reactive handling of program data and filtering logic across components, enabling consistency and a better developer experience.

## ‚úÖ Assumptions & Design Decisions

- Responsive layouts using Ionic's grid system
- The filter state is expected to be reusable across various pages and components; hence, global state management (NgRx) was adopted.
- Component reuse was prioritized by centralizing shared elements under the `components/` directory.
- Routes are assumed to follow RESTful ID-based patterns (e.g., `/programs/detail/:id/:title`).
- Styling and responsiveness were handled using Ionic's component library to accelerate UI development.

## ‚ö† Known Limitations & Areas for Improvement

- **Testing:** Unit and integration tests were not implemented due to time constraints. Future improvements should incorporate testing via Jasmine/Karma or Jest.
- **Caching:** No caching layer was added to reduce repeated API calls. Introducing NgRx Entity or Angular Service Workers could improve performance.
- **Filtering Logic:** A more dynamic filtering mechanism could be implemented if detailed requirements were available.
- **Lazy Loading:** Pages are not lazy-loaded, which could affect performance in larger applications.

Despite these limitations, the development experience was smooth and rewarding.

## üí° Additional Notes

- The codebase is written in TypeScript and uses strict typing for robustness.
- Built using standalone Angular components for cleaner architecture and less module overhead.
- Fully compatible with Ionic Capacitor, making it easily portable to native iOS/Android platforms if needed.
- Ready for deployment using Vercel or other cloud platforms with minimal configuration.
